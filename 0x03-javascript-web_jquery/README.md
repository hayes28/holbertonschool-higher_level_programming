# 0x03. JavaScript - Web jQuery

## Description
This project contains several tasks that involve using JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage. The tasks involve selecting and modifying HTML elements, making AJAX requests, and binding event listeners to DOM and user events.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Why JQuery makes front-end programming so easy
- How to select HTML elements in JavaScript
- How to select HTML elements with JQuery
- What the differences are between ID, class, and tag name selectors
- How to modify an HTML element's style
- How to get and update an HTML element's content
- How to modify the DOM
- How to make a GET request with JQuery AJAX
- How to make a POST request with JQuery AJAX
- How to listen/bind to DOM events
- How to listen/bind to user events

## Tasks
0. No JQuery
Write a JavaScript script that updates the text color of the <header> element to red (#FF0000). You must use document.querySelector to select the HTML tag. You cannot use the JQuery API.

1. With JQuery
Write a JavaScript script that updates the text color of the <header> element to red (#FF0000). You cannot use document.querySelector to select the HTML tag. You must use the JQuery API.

2. Click and turn red
Write a JavaScript script that updates the text color of the <header> element to red (#FF0000) when the user clicks on the tag DIV#red_header. You cannot use document.querySelector to select the HTML tag. You must use the JQuery API.

3. Add .red class
Write a JavaScript script that adds the class red to the <header> element when the user clicks on the tag DIV#red_header. You cannot use document.querySelector to select the HTML tag. You must use the JQuery API.

4. Toggle classes
Write a JavaScript script that toggles the class of the <header> element when the user clicks on the tag DIV#toggle_header. The <header> element must always have one class: red or green, never both at the same time and never empty. If the current class is red, when the user clicks on DIV#toggle_header, the class must be updated to green, and vice versa. You cannot use document.querySelector to select the HTML tag. You must use the JQuery API.

5. List of elements
Write a JavaScript script that adds a <li> element to a list when the user clicks on the tag DIV#add_item. The new element must be: <li>Item</li>. The new element must be added to UL.my_list. You cannot use document.querySelector to select the HTML tag. You must use the JQuery API.

6. Change the text
Write a JavaScript script that updates the text of the <header> element to "New Header!!!" when the user clicks on DIV#update_header. You cannot use document.querySelector to select the HTML tag. You must use the JQuery API.

7. Star Wars character
Write a JavaScript script that fetches the character name from this URL: https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/api/people/5/?format=json. The name must be displayed in the HTML tag DIV#character. You cannot use document.querySelector to select the HTML tag. You must use the JQuery API.
